## Introduction
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
This project aims to understand the dynamics of generalization and memorization in deep neural networks. By investigating the behavior of these models under various conditions, we seek to uncover the mechanisms that drive their learning processes.

## Project Motivation
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
Deep learning models, particularly neural networks, have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, their tendency to memorize rather than generalize poses significant challenges, especially in terms of robustness and reliability. This project is motivated by the need to address these challenges, providing insights and potential solutions.
